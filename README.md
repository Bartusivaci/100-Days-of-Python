## INTRODUCTION:

I'm practicing my coding skills and learning new libraries in Python by following Dr. Angela Yu's course on Udemy. The goal is building 100 different projects from beginner to expert at the end of the course. If you want to follow my progress, check out the projects.  

## USED LIBRARIES SO FAR:

* Turtle Graphics
* Pandas
